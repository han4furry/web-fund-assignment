        <h2 class="header">&#x2728; Making Small Changes</h2>
            <p class="preface"> According to Joseph Poore who led a study at the University of Oxford, UK, who published a study under the Science Magazine titled<a href="https://josephpoore.com/Science%20360%206392%20987%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em> Reducing food&#8217;s environmental impacts through producers and consumers</em></a>:</p>

        <blockquote class="preface">
            “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,”
        </blockquote>

            <p class="preface"> ଘ(੭ˊ꒳​ˋ)੭ ✧ While <strong>Living A Leafier Life</strong> certainly supports those who have decided to implement a vegan diet in their lifestyle, we understand that it is not possible for everyone. However, we believe that normalising the substitution of animal-based ingredients for their plant-based counterparts (where possible) will still contribute to reducing our impact on planet Earth.</p><br>

        <h3 class="header">What is <em>Living a Leafier Life?</em></h3>
            <p class="body-text">Living a Leafier life aims to provide suggestions on plant-based substitutes to some of the most commonly used animal-based ingredients when cooking.</p>

        <h3 class="header">★ Taking the First Step</h3>
            <p class="body-text">If you have found yourself here, there may be a variety of reasons as to why.
             Perhaps you <em>actually</em> are making an attempt to live a 'leafier life',
             but there is of course the possibility that you are allergic or intolerant
             towards an ingredient that you now need, or the very small chance that you
             simply do not have a required ingredient but somehow own plant based ingredients
             that you could use as a substitute. <br><br> <em>Regardless of which category you fit into, we welcome you!</em></p>

        <h3 class="header">★ Tried and Tested</h3>
             <p class="body-text">We have done our best to ensure that with every substitute suggestion, a review will be included so that you may decide which substitute works best for you.</p>

        <h3 class="header">★ Have any suggestions?</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Should you wish to share any of your own substitutes or leave a review on your usage of one of our recommended substitutes, feel free to <a href="contactus.html">drop us a message<a>, and we will get back to you as soon as we can. </p>
