              <li>Silken Tofu: <em>When pureed, silken tofu is a great substitute for the type of thickening egg
                  provides in dishes like egg drop soup.</em></li>
              <li>Carbonated Water: <em>Carbonated water works well to substitute eggs in the making of fluffy bakes
                  goods.</em></li>
              <li>Water + Baking Powder + Oil: <em>The final combination is an easy and excellent substitute in most
                  recipes that need the texture contribution of eggs.</em></li><br>

              <li>Corn: <em>Easy to acquire and a pantry staple, has no additional flavours and works for both savoury
                  and sweet thickening.</em></li>
              <li>Agar: <em>Almost exactly like gelatin, be careful to not use too much as agar tends to have a stiffer
                  final product.</em></li>
              <li>Xanthan gum: <em>Harder to obtain but an excellent substitute, used in many baked goods and
                  desserts.</em></li><br>

              <li>Agave Syrup: <em>Tastes similar to honey but sweeter than sugar.</em></li>
              <li>Cane Sugar: <em>The very basic of all things sweet, sugar. A simple sugar reduction goes a long
                  way.</em></li>
              <li>Maple Syrup: <em>Because who doesn't love maple syrup?</em></li><br>

            <ul type="square">
              <br>
              <li>Nutritional Yeast: <em>The cheapest alternative. While it does provide the colour of cheese on the
                  yellow side, it does not have any melt to it nor does it taste like cheese. Great for sauces
                  though.</em></li>
              <li>Non-dairy cheese: <em>May come in soy or nut types, may or may not melt depending on the brand. They
                  work well with sandwiches and pizza.</em></li>
              <li>Liquid non-dairy cheese: <em>Strangely enough, liquid non-dairy cheese, when used as a pizza cheese,
                  is debatably better that solid non-dairy cheese.</em></li><br>

            <ul type="square">
              <br>
              <li>Non-dairy cream: <em>Usually made from corn syrup, very sweet and caloric dense. Tastes almost exactly
                  like the original, however.</em></li>
              <li>Coconut cream, santan: <em>Spot on with texture (must be cooked through), but adds coconut
                  flavour.</em></li>
              <li>Thickened non-dairy milk: <em>Easy solution is to obtain non-dairy milk and to thicken it with the use
                  of corn starch. Depending on what non-dairy milk you have chosen, final flavour will vary.</em></li>

                strong of a coconut flavour as coconut milk or cream.</em></li>
            <li>Margarine: <em>Easy to find and used by many already, has no additional flavouring.</em></li>
            <li>Vegan shortening: <em>Slightly more difficult to obtain but a little goes a long way as you need less of
                it to substitute butter.</em></li>
